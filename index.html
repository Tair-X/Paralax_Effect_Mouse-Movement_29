					YakhshiMarkets
					
					Web developer
					Developed the concept of an online store on React - https://jorlian4ik.github.io/shop/
					What have I learned working on this project?
					
					• Make up a project specifically for the Opencart system
					• Work with product options, add functionality
					• Work with Opencart modifiers
					• Add your functionality to Opencart
					• Work with the system cache
					• Configure server cache
					• Write scripts to automatically add products
					
					Interesting tasks that I solved
					1. Binding additional. fields to options
					It was necessary to make additional fields for each option, such as:
					Minimum purchase quantity, price, fold quantity, article.
					
					How did you decide?
					I decided by adding extra. fields in the table.
					I brought the appropriate fields to the administrative panel, changed the output / record in the controller.
					
					2. Dynamic change of content on the product page
					After changing the options, in this case it is the tool size, it was necessary to change the desired values, namely:
					Price, minimum purchase quantity, article.
					
					How did you decide?
					In the model, he initially received all the necessary data, transferred it to the controller. In the controller, I wrote
					everything to an array and passed it to js.
					Further, when changing the option to users, I selected the desired values ​​by key and substituted them using js on the
					front
					
					3. Dynamic recalculation after certain actions
					After adding a product, deleting a product, changing the quantity of a product, choosing a delivery method, it was
					necessary to automatically recalculate all amounts without reloading the page
					
					How did you decide?
					I created a single method in the controller, and after the action performed an ajax request, where it transferred the
					actual data or what had changed, then the method returned all the actual data.
					For example:
					We changed the number of items in the cart.
					We sent an ajax request to the controller.
					The controller received the actual data, the amount of the goods, the total amount, and the quantity of the goods. And
					accordingly, we changed everything on the front using JS, so everything works without reloading the page.
